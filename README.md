# Programming-Translation-Techniques
CS 4280 - Compilers course at UMSL

#### Description:
> This course focuses on methods, techniques, and mechanisms used to bridge the abstraction from high level programming to machine level execution. This course also focuses on developing a complex individual project incrementally in separate modules tested and integrated. 


#### Topics:
> This course will be organized around topics relevant to program translation and building a working compiler as a semester project. Basically, every project builds to a final project which will translate an example "higher level language" into simple assembly language, using the given virtual machine for execution. The order of topics presented was as follows:
> - Programming standards: source and architecture
> - Introduction to languages
> - Translation models
> - Lexical analysis
> - Introduction to context free grammars
> - Top down parsing
> - Semantics processing and code generation
> - Testing, project discussions


#### Assignments:
> - Programming Test/Refresher
> - Scanner
> - Parser
> - Static Semantics
> - Code Generation
